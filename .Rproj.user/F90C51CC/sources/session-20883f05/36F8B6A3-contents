## Theory

2.  Define the following terms in a sentence (or short paragraph) and state the formula if appropriate.

    $\text{Var}[\text{b}| x] = \sigma (\mathbf{X'X})^{-1}$

> a)  Heteroskedasticity : is the systematic change in the spread of the residuals over the range of measured values. That is , the variance of the error term varies across observations. $\text{Var}(\epsilon_i|x_i) = \sigma_i^{2}$
>
> b)  White Heteroskedasticity-Consistent Estimator (Use matrix notation in your definition): This estimator allows to estimate the conditional variance of coefficient estimates in the presence of heterogeneity (White, 1980). That is, $$
>     \text{Var}[\text{b} | X] = \sigma^2 (\mathbf{X'X})^{-1}\\ 
>     = (\mathbf{X'X})^{-1} \mathbf{X'\left(\sigma^2I\right)X}\\ 
>     = (\mathbf{X'X})^{-1} \sigma^2 \mathbf{X'X} \\
>     = \sigma^2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbf{x_i'x_i} (\mathbf{X'X})^{-1}
>     $$
>
>     Heterogeneity prensence makes the variance; $$
>     \mathbf({X'X})^{-1} \left[\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sigma^2_i \mathbf{x_i'x_i} \right] (\mathbf{X'X})^{-1}
>     $$
>
>     since the $\sigma^2_i$ is a population variance we replaced with a sample variance of $\ e^2_i$ . Then the variance of b is $$
>     n \mathbf({X'X})^{-1} \left[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} e^2_i \mathbf{x_i'x_i} \right]\mathbf({X'X}^{-1})
>     $$
>
> c)  Bias of an estimator : The 'bias' of an estimator is when difference between its expected value and the true parameter value. An estimator is unbiased when it has zero bias. For the least squares estimator to be unbiased, its expected value should converge to the population parameter as the sample size increases.

3.  Consider the ML and OLS estimators of the population variance, $\tilde\sigma^2=n^{-1}\sum(X_i-\bar X)^2$ and $\hat\sigma^2=(n-1)^{-1}\sum(X_i-\bar X)^2$, where the $X_i$ represent independent draws from a common distribution.\
    \
    Assume that $X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$. What is the (theoretical) finite-sample bias of $\hat\sigma^2$ and $\tilde\sigma^2$?

# Answer

ML estimator for the population variance is

$\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})^2$

,where $\bar X$ is the sample mean. The finite-sample bias of the ML estimator is defined as the difference between the expected value of the estimator and the true population variance:

$\text{Bias}_{ML}(\hat{\sigma}^2) = E(\hat{\sigma}^2) - \sigma$

Given that X follows a normal distribution, it can be shown that:

$E(\hat{\sigma}^{}2) = \frac{n-1}{n} \sigma$

$\Rightarrow \text{Bias}_{ML}(\hat{\sigma}2) = \frac{n-1}{n} \sigma^2 - \sigma^2\\ \Rightarrow \text{Bias}_{ML}(\hat{\sigma}2) = \frac{-\sigma^2}{n}$

The finite sample bias of the OLS estimator is $\text{Bias}_{\text{OLS}}(\sigma^2) = E(\sigma^2) - \sigma$ . Under the assumption of normality, we can say $\text{E}(\sigma^2)= \sigma^2$ . Hence

$\text{Bias}_{\text{OLS}}(\sigma^2)$

# Analysis

4.  In this question we compare standard errors based on (incorrect) asymptotic assumptions with those based on alternate (appropriate) estimator (White). Consider one sample drawn from the following data generating process (DGP) which we will simulate in `R`:

```{r, echo= TRUE}
rm(list=ls())
set.seed(123)
n <- 25
x <- rnorm(n,mean=0.0,sd=1.0)
beta0 <- 1
beta1 <- 0
dgp <- beta0 + beta1*x
e <- x^2*rnorm(n,mean=0.0,sd=1.0)
y <- dgp + e

```

a)  Compute the OLS estimator of $\beta_2$ and its standard error using the `lm()` command in R or the `reg` command in Stata for the model $y_i=\beta_1+\beta_2 x_i+\epsilon_i$ based on the DGP given above. Next, compute the standard error of $\hat\beta_2$ by computing $\hat\sigma^2(X'X)^{-1}$ in using matrix commands in `R` or `Stata`, and verify that the two standard error estimates are identical

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Fit the linear model

model <- lm(y ~ x)

# Extract the coefficient estimates and their standard errors
beta2_hat <- coef(model)[2]
se_beta2_lm <- summary(model)$coefficients[2, "Std. Error"]

# Compute the standard error using matrix commands
X <- cbind(1, x)
y_hat <- predict(model)
residuals <- y - y_hat
sigma_hat_squared <- sum(residuals^2) / (length(y) - 2)  # (n - p), where p is the number of coefficients including intercept
X_transpose_X_inv <- solve(t(X) %*% X)
se_beta2_matrix <- sqrt(sigma_hat_squared * X_transpose_X_inv[2, 2])

# Print the results
cat("OLS Estimator of beta2:", beta2_hat, "\n")
cat("Standard Error of beta2 (lm):", se_beta2_lm, "\n")
cat("Standard Error of beta2 (matrix):", se_beta2_matrix, "\n")

```

Therefore from the above result we see that the two standard errors of beta2 are identica

b)  Compute White's heteroskedasticity consistent covariance matrix estimator (you may use the written functions, e.g., `hccm` function with the option `type="hc0"` from the `R` package `car`) and report the White estimator of the standard error of $\hat\beta_2$. Compare this with that from a) above.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(car)
library(carData)
# Obtain White's heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix
vcov_white <- hccm(model, type = "hc0")

# Extract the standard error of beta2 from the White's covariance matrix
se_beta2_white <- sqrt(vcov_white[2, 2])

cat("Standard Error of beta2 (White):", se_beta2_white, "\n")
```

The White standard error of $\hat\beta^{2}$ is 0.453. Comparing the two standard errors, the White standard error is larger than the OLS standard error. This means that there might be heteroskedasticity in the data.

5.  Use the state-level data on murder rates and executions in MURDER for the following exercise. If you are using `R`, save the file "murder.RData" to your working directory and use the command `load(Murder.RData)`.

> a)  Consider the unobserved effects model $$mrdrte_{it}=\eta_t+\beta_1exec_{it}+\beta_2unem{it}+a_i+u_i$$ where $\eta_t$ simply denotes different year intercepts and $a_i$ is the unobserved state effect. If past executions of convicted murderers have a deterrent effect, what should be the sign of $\beta_1$? What sign do you think $\beta_2$ should have? Explain?

All this being equal, If past executions of convicted murderers have a deterrent effect, then $\beta_1$ will be negative. That is , a deterrent effect means it will discourage individuals from engaging in certain behaviors and hence the coefficient for $\beta_1$ would be negative which implies that past executions of convicted murderers reduces murder rate. $\beta_2$ is expected to have a positive sign. That is, an increase in unemployment rate increases murder rate. This is because, unemployment may cause economic harships and this could encourage social vices among individuals which might result to an increase in illegal activities including murder. Nunley et al. (2011) postulated that unemployment rate has a postiive and signficant influence on murder rates.

b)  Using just the years 1990 and 1993, estimate the population equation from part i) by pooled OLS.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(plm)
load("murder.RData")

#Subset the data 
subset_dt <- subset(data, year %in% c(90, 93))

# Perform pooled OLS regression
model_1 <- lm(mrdrte ~ exec + unem, data = subset_dt)

summary(model_1)


```

c)  Now, using 1990 and 1993, estimate the equation by fixed effects. You may use first differencing because you are only using two years of data. Is there evidence of a deterrent effect? How strong?

    ```{r}

    #subset datasets.

    Murder_90 <- subset(data, year == "90")
    Murder_93 <- subset(data, year == "93")


    #compute difference
    diff_mrdrte <- Murder_93$mrdrte - Murder_90$mrdrte
    diff_exec <- Murder_93$exec - Murder_90$exec
    diff_unem <- Murder_93$unem - Murder_90$unem

    #estimate a regression using differencing
    mrdrte_model <- lm(diff_mrdrte ~ diff_exec + diff_unem)

    summary(mrdrte_model)
    ```

The results suggest evidence of strong a deterrent effect. The results show that, on average, each additional execution is associated with a decrease in the murder rate by approximately -0.10384. Given that murder rates are measured per 100,000 people, a reduction of 0.10384 would be considered significant.

d)  Compute the heteroskedasticity-robust standard error for the estimation in part b).

    ```{r}
    library(sandwich)
    # Compute heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors
    robust_se <- sqrt(diag(vcovHC(mrdrte_model, type = "HC0")))
    cat("Robust Standard Errors:\n", robust_se, "\n")

    ```

The heteroscedasticity robust standard error for the variable ‘past executions’ is 0.01649 and that for ‘annual unemployment rate’ is 0.143

e)  Use all three years of data and estimate the model by fixed effects. Discuss the size and statistical significance of the deterrent effect compared with only using 1990 and 1993.

```{r}
library(plm)
model_2 <- plm(mrdrte ~ exec + unem, data, index = c("state", "year"), model = "within", effect = "twoways")

summary(model_2)
```

The results suggest that a unit increase in past executions reduces murder rates by 0.138382. However, this is not statistically significant. This is deterrent effect is larger but not statistically significant compared to the model where only two years of data are used.
